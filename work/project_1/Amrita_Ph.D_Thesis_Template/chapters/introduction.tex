\section{title of first section in this chapter}
A literature review is much more than a list of separate reviews of articles and books.  They are common and very important in the sciences.  A literature review is a critical, analytical summary and synthesis of the current knowledge of a topic.  It should compare and relate different theories, findings, and so on, rather than just summarize them individually.  It should also have a particular focus or theme to organize the review.  It does not have to be an exhaustive account of everything published on the topic.  But it should discuss all the more significant academic literature important for that focus.
