# Thermal Image Processing Techniques: Literature Review

## Overview

This repository contains a LaTeX project documenting the literature review on **Thermal Image Processing Techniques**. The report is divided into four major sections, covering key areas such as image enhancement, object detection and tracking, environmental adaptation, and deep learning architectures. Each section includes references to selected research papers and summarizes their contributions.

### Sections

1. **Image Enhancement Techniques**
   - Focus on improving the quality of thermal images through contrast enhancement and noise reduction techniques.
   
2. **Object Detection and Tracking**
   - Discusses methods for detecting and tracking objects in thermal images, particularly in real-time applications.

3. **Environmental Adaptation**
   - Explores techniques for adapting thermal imaging systems to outdoor environments, including calibration and compensation for thermal drift.

4. **Deep Learning Architectures**
   - Reviews state-of-the-art deep learning models applied to tasks such as classification, segmentation, and denoising of thermal images.
